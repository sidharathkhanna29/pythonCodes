Loops (Repetition Structures)
Functions
Use of API in python (Libraries)

Repetition Structures :
1) Condition Controls (while loop) ---> when you don't know how many times
you repeat something
2) Count Controls ---> When you do know how many times you repeat something

for ---> iterators ----> through something itables

"""

# what is an iterables?
# are objects (Its a complex data structure) which is in sequence
# iterators (for each)

# index

# if you want to repeat something 5 times
# range() ----> creates a range of numbers
# range(start = 0, stop, step = 1)
# start of a range is inclusive and stop is exclusive

# Functions (Modules) ---------------------------
# managing your code in python may be challenging.
# code org. its not easy!
# Modularization which help you manage your code better
# team work.... and debug your code more efficiently.
# functions are 2 types : 1) pre-defined 2) self-defined
# in order to use function or modules you have to call them
